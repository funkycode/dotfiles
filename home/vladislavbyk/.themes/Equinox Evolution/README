Known issue
===========

By default, the menu of Network Manager Applet does not appear in dark.
You can enforce this behaviour from the gnome-session-properties application. Locate the item corresponding to the Network Manager and change its command line from :
  
  nm-applet --sm-disable

To:
  
  bash -c 'GTK2_RC_FILEs=/usr/share/themes/Equinox\ Evolution/gtk-2.0/apps/nm-applet.gtkrc nm-applet --sm-disable'

Of course, you may change the path above if the Equinox Evolution theme is installed into your personnal folder (~/.themes).
